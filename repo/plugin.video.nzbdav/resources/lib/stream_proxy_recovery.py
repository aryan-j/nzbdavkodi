"""Upstream-reachability, starvation, and recovery-summary notifications.

Extracted from ``stream_proxy.py`` (Stage 1 decomposition). Groups upstream
error classification, the per-server unreachable/recovered flag transitions,
one-shot starvation detection + user notification, the per-session recovery
state accounting, and the end-of-stream recovery-summary notification. All
names are re-exported by ``stream_proxy`` so existing references and test
patches keep resolving.

Plain constants are imported from ``stream_proxy``; parent helpers and any
monkeypatch target (``xbmc``, ``_notify``) are reached at call time via
``_sp.<name>`` so patching keeps working.
