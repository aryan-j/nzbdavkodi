    Kodi saves a bookmark (resume point) keyed on the *outer* plugin URL —

    user replays the same plugin URL, Kodi auto-resumes from the bookmark,
    which triggers a bug where CVideoPlayer tries to reopen the plugin URL
    itself as an input stream and fails with
    ``OpenInputStream - error opening [plugin://...]``. Playback never
    starts and the user sees dialog 30121.

    Deleting the bookmark before each play forces Kodi to treat every play
    as a fresh first play, which bypasses the broken resume pipeline.

    Called from the resolve flow with the params that led to this play so
    we can also target the TMDBHelper URL (not just our own plugin URL).

    Safety model: this code mutates Kodi's primary video database, so the
    mutation surface is kept as narrow as possible:

    * Only the ``bookmark`` table is modified. The ``files``, ``settings``,
      and ``streamdetails`` tables are left alone — a row in ``files``
      without a matching ``bookmark`` row is the "fresh play" state Kodi
      already handles correctly, and not touching the foreign-key parent
      avoids cascading into unrelated library state.
    * The SQLite busy timeout is short (2s). If Kodi is actively writing we
      bail out rather than contend — a missed cleanup is recoverable; a
      long stall on the resolve path is not.
    * LIKE wildcards (``%``, ``_``, ``\\``) in ``tmdb_id`` are escaped so
      an odd TMDBHelper param value cannot match unrelated rows.
    * ``sqlite3.OperationalError`` (the "database is locked" case) is
      caught separately and logged at DEBUG; everything else is logged at
      WARNING so real problems surface in the Kodi log.
