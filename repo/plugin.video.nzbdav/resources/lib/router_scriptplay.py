"""RunScript-player (``_handle_script_play``) helpers split out of ``router``.

``_handle_script_play`` stays in ``router`` (the suite imports/patches it from
there) and drives the helpers here. Every router-resident or router-patched
name (``_search_all_providers``, ``_get_script_setting``, ``_tag_available``,
``_script_completed_job_for_selection``, ``_string``, the loading-dialog
helpers, …) is reached at call time through ``import resources.lib.router as
_router`` so the suite's ``@patch("resources.lib.router.<name>")`` decorators
keep resolving and no top-level import cycle is introduced.
