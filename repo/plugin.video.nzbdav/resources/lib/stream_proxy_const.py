"""Module-level configuration constants for ``stream_proxy``.

Extracted verbatim from ``stream_proxy.py`` (god-file dissolution). These are
the immutable timeouts, byte budgets, regexes, sentinels, and tuples that the
proxy and its ``stream_proxy_*`` sibling mixins read. ``stream_proxy`` re-exports
every name here via an explicit ``from resources.lib.stream_proxy_const import
(...)`` list -- explicit, not ``import *``, so static analysers can follow the
re-export chain -- so ``stream_proxy.<NAME>`` references, the siblings'
``_sp.<NAME>`` reads, the default-arg captures in the handler/producer class
bodies, and test ``@patch`` targets all keep resolving unchanged. The mutable
module state with ``global`` mutators (the ``_proxy`` singleton and the
``_HLS_PRIVATE_TEMP_ROOT`` cache, plus their locks) stays in ``stream_proxy``;
only the true immutable constants live here.
